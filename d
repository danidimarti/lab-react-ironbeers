  Why we pointed out the type? Well, since we already console log response from the API, we could notice that all the fields are strings but *attenuation_level*, which is number. Using our knowledge from module II, we can make conclusion that in the *beer model* all the properties are type *String* except *attenuation_level*, which is type *Number*.[m
[31m--When you have built the form, you should do a `POST` request to `https://ih-beer-api.herokuapp.com/beers/new`, passing all the data on the `body` object. If everything went ok, you would receive a **200** response from the server. [m

  [m
  Notice that the fields on the `body` should have those specific **names** so the API can create a new beer.[m

  Yes! One endpoint left! On the `/beers` route, add an `input` where users can search for beers. Every time a new letter is typed, you should call to `https://ih-beer-api.herokuapp.com/beers/search?q={query}` passing the value of the input in the `q` param.[m
